# defi-projects
A collection of decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and smart contracts. Includes implementations of on-chain protocols, token contracts, staking mechanisms, and other DeFi-related functionalities. Built for experimentation, learning, and exploring blockchain-based financial systems.



# DeFi Projects

This repository contains a collection of decentralized finance (DeFi) projects and smart contracts.  
It serves as a workspace for experimenting with blockchain-based protocols and concepts.

## Contents
- **Smart Contracts** – Solidity contracts for tokens, staking, yield farming, etc.
- **Protocol Implementations** – On-chain logic for DeFi mechanisms.
- **Testing & Deployment Scripts** – Hardhat/Truffle scripts for compiling, deploying, and testing.
- **Utilities** – Helper functions and scripts for interacting with contracts.

## Tech Stack
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum / EVM-compatible chains
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Frameworks**: Hardhat / Truffle
- **Scripting**: JavaScript / TypeScript

## Purpose
These projects were created for personal exploration and practice in DeFi development — covering everything from contract writing to testing and deployment.

## Disclaimer
These contracts are for **development and testing purposes only**.  
Do not use them in production without proper auditing.
